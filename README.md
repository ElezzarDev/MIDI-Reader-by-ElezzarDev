~MIDI-Reader-by-ElezzarDev~
this applications sole purpose is to print MIDI messages and relavant information to a text document.
it was written in C with CodeBlocks IDE and uses no libraries outside of the C standard library.
I originally created it for MIDSi a nintendo DS homebrew game I'm working on but I'm uploading it here for educational/example/archival purposes

the MIDI file to be read must be named "open.mid" without the quotes and placed in the same directory as the executable "MIDI Player.exe"
